What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a .git folder(directory) is created to enable the tracking of commits on files in repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area holds files that are ready to commit. Once work on all files in the working directory has reached a logical commit stage, files in the staging area can be committed together.
