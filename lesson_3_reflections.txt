When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
more control over local repository. if conflicts exist it is possible to resolve them when manually pulling. Automatically pulling could cause problems with  code that has not been committed/pushed.
